The `mathlib` project is actively maintained and updated. In the interest of reproducibility, you may want to manage your code's dependency on `mathlib` using the [`leanproject`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/leanproject.html) command-line tool. This will help ensure others can retrieve the right version of `mathlib` for your project.

Lean was introduced in the paper ["The Lean Theorem Prover"](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Lean-Theorem-Prover-(System-Description)-Moura-Kong/2a441a46e228ed0ea2251a4e61be6c7025b45766), by de Moura et al., which you can cite using:
